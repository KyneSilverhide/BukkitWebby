# BukkitWebby
Bukkit Webby is a lightweight web administration that is easy and fast to setup It's made of two components :
- WebbyBukkitPlugin is a Bukkit Plugin that interacts with Bukkit, read your server log, find all online users, etc.
- WebbyRTK is a RTK module that interacts with RemoteToolkit and run the webserver. Even if Bukkit has been shutdown, the webserver will persists and allow you to restart Bukkit.
You don't need to setup a webserver yourself. Apache is not needed. You don't need anything else than Bukkit and RTK.
